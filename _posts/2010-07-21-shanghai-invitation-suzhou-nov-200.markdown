In the cold November air 38 lads and lassies traveled down from  Shanghai for a game of some sort against the newly crowned Asian Games  Games Plate Champions.  After a couple of closely contested 9 a side  games with the 2 clubs splitting up there teams, it was decided to have a  15 a side game.  Although the experience of shanghai shown through with  some excellent points it was the goal scoring of Suzhou that kept us in  it right up to the end, going down by only 4 points.

When the football finished the real business started with the 2 teams  partying hard into the early hours in Zapatas.  A great day and night  was had by all.
