> This Saturday's practice will NOT be taking place. However, we will DEFINITELY have practice next Saturday the 8th at 3pm (location TBD) in the lead up to back-to-back weekends of games against Shanghai.

> This Sunday night at 10:30pm there will be a LIVE Gaelic Football match on at Zapatas - The GAA Football All Ireland Championship 2012 Semi-Final featuring Dublin vs. Mayo. This is a great chance for anyone who has never watched a live match to see how it's really played in Ireland.

> Next Tuesday the 4th at 7:30pm we will have practice outside at Wenxing Plaza. Meet at Blue Marlin at 7pm. This is a turf pitch so bring proper footwear. Going forward, we will be practicing on Tuesdays instead of Thursdays, so please adjust your schedules accordingly.

> We will play Shanghai here in Suzhou on the 15th followed by a BBQ and travel as a club to Shanghai for an invitational against both Shanghai and Beijing on the 22nd. It is very important that people come out for these games as they offer some of the few opportunities before the All Asia Games in October to play other Gaelic teams. Details coming next week.

We look forward to seeing everyone either Sunday night for the live game or Tuesday for practice.

Enjoy your weekend,
- The Suzhou GAA
