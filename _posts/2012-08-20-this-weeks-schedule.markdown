Hi everybody,
Thanks everyone for the great turnout at practice last Thursday (~20 players), as well as for the Kunshan Beer Fest on Saturday night (40+), extending on to the close of BM Sunday AM. It was a testament to the club that we were able to get such good numbers for both events and we hope to bring you more social events as the season continues on.

Hopefully everyone has recovered from their hangovers and is ready for practice again this week.

> EarlyBird training tomorrow morning (Tuesday the 21st) at 6:15am at Pink Flamingo Park on Xinggang Jie. Please RSVP to Katie at katie@boland-business.com for this event if you plan on attending. This activity will be cancelled if it is raining.
> We will have a full practice again at the same time and same place this week 7:30-9:30pm on Thursday the 23rd at Wenxing Plaza (meet at Blue Marlin at 7pm).
> NO practice is scheduled for next Saturday.
> In addition, the Suzhou Singapore International School will be holding a regular sports night on Wednesdays starting in September for those that would like to get a little more exercise in. See details at the end of this email.

See everyone Thursday if not beforehand.
BR,
Suzhou GAA
