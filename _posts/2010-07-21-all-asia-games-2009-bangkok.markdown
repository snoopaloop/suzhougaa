Suzhou "Eire Og" GAA club  traveled to there first Asian Gaelic Games in Bangkok and put Suzhou on  the map.  Due to this being our first tournament we were bottom seed in  our group which included top seeds Shenzhen, Vietnam and an experienced  Japan B team.  With a 9am start the first night was an earlish night  with thankfully our captain Derek "right over left" Swan getting to bed.

Suzhou 2-5 Japan B 0-3

In Suzhou's first match  the midfeild partnership of Wooey and Swaner controlled the center of  the park and gave Suzhou the basis of an emphatic win.  Mick O'Hagen  settled the nerves of Suzhou with a couple of early points and then a  high ball into Niall McGuinness caused serious problems for the Nippon  defense and the rugby tackled him to the ground for Swaner to put the  resulting penalty into the top corner.  Just before half time a great  ball over the top had the Japan keeper stranded in no mans land and  Joseba calmly lobbed the keeper for a brillant goal.  The second half  was a lot closer but with Mick, Kevin and Swaner clipping over points  Japan never looked like catching Suzhou

Suzhou 0-7 Shenzhen 1-7

In Suzhou's second match  they went up against the top seeds Shenzhen who were beaten in there  first match against Vietnam.  With some rain between matches the  underfoot conditions were slippery as was the ball.  With a close  opening half, they teams went in even.  In the second half Suzhou lead  by a point for must of the match with Shenzhen staying in contention.  A  goal with the last kick of the game ended with Shenzhen winning by 3.

Suzhou 1-8 Vietnam 2-3

Suzhou got into there  stride quickly pick off points to rush into a 0-4 to 0 lead.  Vietnam  stepped it up coming towards the half and they had two goal bound shots  saved by the author.    Suzhou went in at half time 4 points up but  conceded a goal just after half time after the keeper pulled off another  mighty save but couldnt hold onto it and the rebound was calmly put  into the back of the net.  Suzhou put more pressure on and soon got  there reward with a Joseba goal.  Vietnam pulled another goal back but  it was too little too late as Suzhou held on for a 2 point margin.
