A depleted Suzhou  traveled to rugby grounds of Pudong for a 4 team inviation with Dalian  and 2 Shanghai teams.  Leaving Suzhou with 6 players we managed to  recruit another Pitch side, poached Mick Bowens for the second time and  Dalian generiously borrowed us Angelo and Scott.

First Match: Suzhou 0-6   Shanghai A 0-8.  A great effort from a bunch of lads that were only  getting together for the first time, putting it up to the power houses  of Asia.  As usual Swaner was the ever ready bunny in the middle and  Kevin and Mick picked off some lovely points to keep us in contention  right til the death.  Suzhou came close to a goal in the dying stages  with Kevins fisted effort cleared off the line.

Second Match: Suzhou 2-6  Shanghai B 1-4.  A fine battle with suzhou conceding a goal in the  opening minute.  A switch at half time between Pebo and Martin proved to  be the winning stroke with both having a stroming second half.

Third Match: Suzhou 1-5  Dalian 1-6.  Another close battle which was won with the last kick of  the game, a free from 15 yards.  Mick Bowens took no prisinors at the  back so it was no surprise he gave away the free.....  only joking Mick,  you can play with us all the time.  Mick up front again was in flying  form.

Fourth Match Suzhou beat  Shanghai B.  In the Losers final Suzhou were in there stride and won  easily against Shanghai B in what was a repeat of the All China  Championship Bowl Final.  Moment of the match was the goal celebration  from Don.

All in all a good trip  and its a pity we didnt have a full team, there would have been a few  upsets.
