Thanks to all that made it to the Asian Gaelic Games in Korea, there were some heroic performances both on and off the pitch.  It was a great weekend which the ladies capped off by winning the bowl in a close final with Shanghai.  The lads were beaten in a semi final that they dominated in possession and territory but couldnt get the scores on the board.

Congrads to the Suzhou Ladies who combined with Dalian to win the All Asian Gaelic Games bowl after beating the Shanghai A team in the final.  Well done Halle, Sherry, Qing and Jade.......
