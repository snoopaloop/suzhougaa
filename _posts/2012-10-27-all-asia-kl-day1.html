		<p>The Suzhou lads went into the 2012 All-Asias in Kuala Lumpur with a strong team that has been training hard all year in preparation for these games. After a late start to the day in the intense heat, the Eire Og went hard into their match with Taiwan, but were defeated in their opening match. They could not overcome a sluggish first half, but came back strong in the second half, nearly drawing level before running out of time.</p>
		<p>The Eire Og had high hopes going into the second match with Mongolia, but soon found that they had lost the form they had shown in the second half of the Taiwan match before falling to a tough Mongolia team with the frustration and exhaustion beginning to show.</p>
		<p>In the third match of the day, the Suzhou Eire Og knew it was a do or die situation and came out fast and hard against Malaysia. Suzhou quickly built a comfortable lead and held off all challenges from Malaysia. Behind some tough goals by Michael "Black-Eye" Tame and John David "JDizzle" Nash, as well as the superb play of the whole team, the Suzhou Eire Og improved their chances for the second day of competition.</p>
		<p>In the final match of the day, the Eire Og faced a strong Japanese team. The strong push in the match with Malaysia had taken its toll on Suzhou and they were unable to put together a win in a heavy downpour at the end of the day.</p>
