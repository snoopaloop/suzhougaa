Suzhou GAA were founded in the summer of 2008 as a favour to our neighbors Shanghai Saints to come up and teach them a thing or two about winning and not bottling.  So after successful trip to Shanghai the Suzhou GAA were born.  In 2009 there was a recruitment drive to part take in the All China Games and with a few training sessions under our belts off to Shanghai again.  We were drawn in the group of Death but faired ok with our first ever competitive point coming from a draw with the well established Beijing.  From there we went undefeated to pick up the All China Gaelic Games Bowl.

Suzhou GAA would like to thank the 2009 Sponsors Glanbia, Jack Murphy and NR Global Engineering Solutions.
